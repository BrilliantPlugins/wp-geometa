Store and search spatial metadata like any other metadata, but while taking advantage of MySQL spatial types and indexes.

== Description == 

A spatial foundation for WordPress. Store and search spatial metadata like you do any other metadata, but using MySQL spatial indexes.

WP GeoMeta lets you take advantage MySQL's spatial data types and spatial indexes when storing and searching spatial metadata. 

It detects when [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) metadata is being stored, and transparently stores a copy in a spatial meta table. 

WP GeoMeta also adds support for spatial search operators. When a spatial search operator is used, WP GeoMeta will make sure that the spatial table is used, taking advantage of indexes and spatial relations.

WP GeoMeta isn't just a plugin, it's also a library which other plugins can take advantage of. It's meant to be a spatial platform that other GIS and mapping plugins can build on to allow spatial interoperability between plugins.

== Installation ==

Install this plugin in the usual WordPress way, then go to your WordPress dashboard to Tools::WP GeoMeta to see the status of your spatial data and to use the included tools.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-geometa` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugin screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Go to Tools::WP Geometa

WP-GeoMeta is tested and developed in the open over at [GitHub](https://github.com/BrilliantPlugins/wp-geometa). Stable versions are pushed to  the WordPress plugin repository. 

There is more developer documentation in the GitHub repository and I'd love to get pull requests and bug reports over there (but I'll take them via SVN too if that's what you like better).
